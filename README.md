# Final_Project

Our code is all compiled on a single jupyter notebook containing the following steps:

1. Data cleaning
2. Data filtering
3. Training SVD model
4. Training knn model


To run the code the only file needed aside from our jupyter notebook is the ratings_Electronics.csv, which contains the raw data for our model training. The entire data cleaning and filtering pipeline is already included in the notebook so the only step needed is to upload the data when running the notebook.
